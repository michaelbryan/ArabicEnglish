    While there are close to 10,000 entries in this dictionary, some Jordanian words are still not here... yet.  Look at the 'About' section for contact information so you can contribute.
    The result buttons obviously do not display Arabic perfectly.  There are very small spaces between letters that should be connected, and worse, when Arabic text is wrapped the multiple lines have to be read from bottom to top.  These are bugs of the software in which the app was written, and should be remedied at future updates.
    Luckily, and for now, you should be able to view the 'Full Entry' and the 'Verb Chart' pages with correct Arabic display.
