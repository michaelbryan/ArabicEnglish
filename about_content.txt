    This dictionary was created to reflect the spoken Arabic of Jordan.  This means that it falls under the category of the broader Levantine Dialect, which includes the Arabic spoken in Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria.  While different, these dialects are mutually intelligible.  
    You will also find with this app that there is a big overlap with Modern Standard Arabic, especially when it comes to more technical or intellectual vocabulary.  Such is the case with all dialects.  Close to 80% of all the Arabic dialects is overlapping vocabulary.  Still, in colloquial dialects, the 20% that is different gets used the most.
    This dictionary was created especially to focus on the 20% of the language which is very Jordanian.  With close to 10,000 entries, incuding key phrases, it accomplishes that objective fairly well, along with a lot of Arabic that is useful anywhere.  
    However, it is not perfect.  If you find Jordanian Arabic words or short phrases that are not here, you can help make this dictionary truly exhaustive by contributing through email.

This app was created in Python and Kivy.  It was the project of Michael M. and all responsibility for mistakes in the content and the programming fall to him.

Special thanks go to Clark, without whose help the app never would have been started, and Abd Allah, whose arabic reshaper tool saved the day.
