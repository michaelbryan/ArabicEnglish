    This dictionary was created to reflect the spoken Arabic of Jordan.  This means that it falls under the category of the broader Levantine Dialect, which includes the Arabic spoken in Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria.  While different, these dialects are mutually intelligible.  
    You will also find with this app that there is a big overlap with Modern Standard Arabic, especially when it comes to more technical or intellectual vocabulary.  Such is the case with all dialects.  Close to 80% of all the Arabic dialects is overlapping vocabulary.  Still, in colloquial dialects, the 20% that is different gets used the most.
    This dictionary was created especially to focus on the 20% of the language which is very Jordanian.  With over 10,000 entries, incuding key phrases, it covers that area, along with a lot of Arabic that is useful anywhere.
    However, it is not perfect.  If you find Jordanian Arabic words or short phrases that are not here, you can help make this dictionary truly exhaustive by contributing through email.
